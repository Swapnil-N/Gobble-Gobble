### Architecture

The project follows a **modular, service-oriented architecture**:
- **Layered Design:** React UI ↔ Event System ↔ Phaser Game Engine
- **Separation of Concerns:** Configuration, entities, services, and scenes are isolated
- **SOLID Principles:** Single responsibility per module, dependency injection
- **Orchestrator Pattern:** `MainScene` delegates to specialized services rather than implementing logic

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React 19 + TypeScript
- **Game Engine:** Phaser 3.90
- **Build Tool:** Vite 7
- **Backend:** Firebase (Firestore) - Shared instance for all players
- **Styling:** CSS3

---

## 🔥 Firebase Integration

### Collections

The game uses Firestore to store scores in the `scores` collection:

#### `scores`
Stores individual game scores for the global leaderboard.

```typescript
{
  name: string,      // Player name
  score: number,     // Final score
  level: number,     // Level reached
  date: Timestamp    // When played
}
```

**All players share the same leaderboard** - compete globally!

---

## 🏆 Leaderboard

View top scores by clicking **"Leaderboard"** from:
- Main menu
- Game over screen

Top 10 players are displayed with:
- Rank
- Player name
- Score
- Level reached

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Shared Firebase Instance
- This game uses a shared Firebase backend for all players
- All scores are saved to a common leaderboard
- Firebase configuration is already included in the project
- No additional setup required!

### Security
Firestore Security Rules are configured to:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /scores/{document=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.resource.data.score < 100000; // Prevent cheating
    }
  }
}
```
